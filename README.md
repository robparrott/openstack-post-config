openstack-post-config
=====================

Set of scripts to configure and create objects in a successfully built OpenStack environment.

For now assumes that

- that there's a set of auth credentials in `/root/keystonerc_admin` or `/root/openrc`, and 
- there's a packstack answers file in `/root/answers.txt` or those values aren't needed.
